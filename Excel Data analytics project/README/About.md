 - Access to safe drinking water remains a critical global development challenge, characterized by significant disparities across regions, income groups, and population types. 

- This study analyzes country-level estimates of access to drinking water services between 2000 and 2020, focusing on national, rural, and urban populations.

 - Using structured data transformation and feature engineering, population shares are estimated and Annual Rates of Change (ARC) are calculated to assess progress over time. 

- To avoid saturation bias, ARC values are filtered to exclude countries that have already achieved 100% access, ensuring that measured changes reflect meaningful improvements.

- Descriptive statistics and measures of dispersion are used to summarize access levels, while regional classifications enable comparative analysis across geographic groups.

- A range of visualizations, including stacked column charts, box-and-whisker plots, histograms, and bubble charts, are employed to explore patterns and inequalities in access and rates of change. 

- The findings highlight persistent regional disparities and demonstrate that higher ARC values do not necessarily indicate greater overall progress, particularly in contexts where full access has already been achieved.
