##  Project Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end **Power BI analytics workflow**, transforming complex, multi-table data into **interactive, decision‑maker‑focused dashboards**.

The analysis focuses on **water access, queue behavior, pollution, crime correlation, and infrastructure investment** across the fictional country of **Maji Ndogo**.

The report is structured into **two major parts**:

* **Part 2:** National analysis & exploratory visuals
* **Part 3:** Executive, financial & decision‑making dashboards

---

##  Data Model Overview

The Power BI data model was designed using **star and multi‑star schema concepts** to support efficient filtering and cross‑visual interaction.

**Key Tables Used:**

* `visits` (fact table)
* `location`
* `water_source`
* `queue_composition`
* `well_pollution`
* `project_progress`
* `infrastructure_cost`
* `water_source_related_crime`

**Techniques Applied:**

* Relationship modeling
* Power Query transformations
* Calculated columns and measures (DAX)
