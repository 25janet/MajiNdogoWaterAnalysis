# 📊 Power BI Report – Water Access Analysis (Maji Ndogo)
**Project Parts:** Part 2 & Part 3  
**Tool:** Microsoft Power BI  
**Author:** Shiru  
**Project Type:** Data Visualization & Analytics Portfolio  

---

##  Project Context

This project focuses on analyzing **water access, queue behavior, pollution, and infrastructure investment** across the fictional country of **Maji Ndogo**.  

The goal was to build **decision-maker–focused Power BI dashboards** that transform complex, multi-table datasets into **clear, actionable insights** at both **national and provincial levels**.

---

##  Data Model Overview

- Built a **multi-table data model** using:
  - `visits` (fact table)
  - `location`
  - `water_source`
  - `queue_composition`
  - `well_pollution`
  - `project_progress`
  - `infrastructure_cost`
  - `water_source_related_crime`
- Implemented **star and multi-star schema concepts**
- Ensured correct relationships for cross-filtering
- Prepared calculated columns using **Power Query** and **DAX**

# 🔹 PART 2: National-Level Analysis & Visual Exploration

### 🎯 Objective
To provide a **bird’s-eye view** of water access and usage across Maji Ndogo and explore patterns in **queues, pollution, and demographics**.

---

##  National Overview Page – Visualizations Created

###  1. Map Visualization
- **Filled Map of Provinces**
- Displays water-related metrics per province
- Enables cross-filtering across all visuals

###  2. Population Distribution
- **Pie / Donut Chart**
- Urban vs Rural population split

###  3. Source Type Distribution
- **Tree Map**
- Total number of people served per water source type

###  4. Water Source Availability by Town
- **Column Chart**
- Number of water source types per town

###  5. Water Source Count by Type
- **Column Chart**
- Count of different water sources (wells, taps, etc.)

---

## ⏱ Queue Analysis Page – Visualizations Created

###  6. Map (Filtered for Queue Analysis)
- Province-level filtering of queue behavior

###  7. Average Queue Composition by Gender
- **Stacked Column Chart**
- Breakdown of men, women, and children in queues

###  8. Queue Composition by Day of Week
- **Column Chart**
- Highlights weekday vs weekend patterns

###  9. Queue Composition by Hour
- **Line Chart**
- Shows how queue demographics change throughout the day

 Demonstrates **interactive filtering** (multi-select across visuals).

---

##  Pollution Analysis Page – Visualizations Created

###  10. Pollution Density Map
- **Map with Color Saturation**
- Visualizes pollution concentration per area

###  11. Pollution Results Breakdown
- **Composition Chart**
- Clean vs Chemically Contaminated vs Biologically Contaminated sources

---

##  Crime & Water Source Analysis

###  12. Crime-Linked Water Sources
- Visuals connecting historical crime data to water source locations
- Enables correlation analysis between safety and access

---

# 🔹 PART 3: Decision-Maker Dashboard & Financial Insights

###  Objective
To design a **policy-maker–focused report** that answers:
- How many people lack basic water access?
- What improvements are needed?
- How much will it cost?
- Where should the money be spent?

---

##  Executive Summary Section – Visualizations

###  13. KPI Cards
- **Total Cost of Upgrades**
- **Current % of Basic Water Access**
- **% Improvement After Completion**

> Includes DAX formatting for percentage change indicators.

---

##  Budget & Investment Analysis – Visualizations

### 📋 14. Budget Table by Province
- Total cost of upgrades per province

###  15. Budget Table by Improvement Type
- Cost breakdown by infrastructure improvement category

###  16. Budget Allocation Visualization
- Percentage of total budget per province

---

##  Bookmark & Navigation Design

###  17. Interactive Bookmarks
- **Province View**
- **Improvements View**
- Toggle using buttons and selection pane

This allows decision-makers to **switch focus without cluttering the report**.

---

##  Provincial Drill-Through Pages

###  18. Provincial-Level Dashboards
For each province:
- Urban vs Rural population split
- Budget allocation visuals
- Town-level cost and quantity breakdown
- Drill-through enabled from the national dashboard

---

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated

- Power BI Data Modeling  
- Power Query transformations  
- DAX calculated measures  
- Interactive dashboard design  
- Bookmark & drill-through navigation
